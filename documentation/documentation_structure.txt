01️⃣ Product Definition
Ask AI for:

Product purpose

Core problem statement

Value proposition

Target users

What it does NOT do

One-line pitch

Long-form explanation

Vision statement

This becomes your foundation document.

02️⃣ Problem Research

Ask AI:

Current workflow in colleges

Why existing ERPs fail at early detection

Market gap analysis

Stakeholder pain points

Institutional constraints

Data availability issues

This gives you judge-level confidence.

03️⃣ Technical Architecture

This is CRITICAL.

Ask AI to define:

Final tech stack (Streamlit + Pandas + Plotly)

Why this stack is optimal for hackathon

App structure (file structure)

Data processing pipeline

State handling strategy

Deployment options (local / cloud)

Scalability path if moving beyond hackathon

This prevents overengineering.

04️⃣ Risk Engine Design

Very important.

Ask AI for:

Formal risk formula

Edge case handling

Override rules

False positive prevention

Risk scoring logic flow diagram

Future ML integration path

This is your intellectual core.

05️⃣ UI / UX Design

Ask AI:

Dashboard layout structure

Admin view design

Teacher view design

Interaction flow

Chart types

Heatmap structure

Demo UX psychology

This makes demo smooth.

06️⃣ Data Model

Ask AI to define:

Required CSV schema

Field definitions

Data normalization logic

Relationship between entities

How to scale to multi-college

Optional future fields

This protects you later.

07️⃣ Hackathon Strategy

Ask AI for:

30-sec pitch script

4-min demo script

Judge psychology breakdown

What to emphasize

What to avoid

Backup demo strategy

Submission checklist

This wins hackathons.

08️⃣ Testing & Validation

Ask AI:

Edge case scenarios

Sample synthetic dataset design

Testing checklist

Demo rehearsal checklist

Failure recovery plan

You need this as solo builder.

09️⃣ Roadmap (Post Hackathon)

Ask AI:

Phase 2 features

ERP API integration

ML-based prediction roadmap

Automation roadmap

Multi-tenant SaaS path

Infrastructure changes required

This shows maturity.

🔟 Risks & Limitations

Ask AI:

Technical risks

Adoption risks

Data quality risks

Scaling risks

Legal/privacy risks

Scope creep risks

Judges LOVE awareness of limitations.

README.md (Very Important)

Should contain:

Project overview

Quick start guide

Tech stack

File structure

How to run

Demo flow

Screenshots

Future scope

This makes your project professional.
