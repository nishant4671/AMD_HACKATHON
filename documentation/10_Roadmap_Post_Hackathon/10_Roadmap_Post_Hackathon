# AEWIS Post-Hackathon Roadmap

**Current State:** Hackathon MVP (Streamlit + CSV + Rules)  
**Timeline:** 6-18 months to revenue  
**Success Metric:** 3 paying colleges by Month 12  
**Budget Reality:** Solo bootstrap ($100/month max)  

***

## Phase 3: ERP Integration (Month 4-6)
**Goal:** Eliminate manual CSV → $10k ARR

| Category | Deliverables | Why Critical |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Features** | - Fedena API plugin<br>- Google Classroom sync<br>- Auto daily attendance pull<br>- Slack/Email risk alerts | CSV fatigue kills adoption |
| **Architecture** | - Event-driven (webhooks)<br>- Redis cache for real-time<br>- Multi-region Postgres | ERPs push data automatically |
| **Technical** | - Docker + Railway ($20/mo)<br>- OAuth2 for ERP auth<br>- Airbyte for custom ERPs | 90% Indian colleges covered |
| **Business** | - ₹500/student/year pricing<br>- 10 paid colleges<br>- HOD demo video series | Manual CSV = 0% retention |

**Success:** 80% data automated. **Cost:** $50/mo. **Time:** 120 hours.

***

## Phase 4: ML Prediction Layer (Month 7-9)
**Goal:** Predict failures 4 weeks early → Enterprise sales

| Category | Deliverables | Why Critical |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Features** | - Dropout prediction (AUC 0.85)<br>- Teacher effectiveness scores<br>- Personalized interventions<br>- "What-if" simulator | Rules → ML = 3x accuracy |
| **Architecture** | - MLflow model registry<br>- Feature store (Hopsworks)<br>- Online scoring API | Daily predictions at scale |
| **Technical** | - XGBoost + SHAP explanations<br>- Cron retraining (weekly)<br>- Modal.com inference ($0.10/hr) | Proves 25% dropout reduction |
| **Business** | - ₹1500/student premium tier<br>- District-level contracts<br>- Academic paper co-authorship | ML = credibility for grants |

**Success:** Predict 80% of failures before Quiz1. **Cost:** $150/mo. **Time:** 200 hours.

***

## Phase 5: Multi-Tenant SaaS (Month 10-18)
**Goal:** $100k ARR → Raise $500k seed

| Category | Deliverables | Why Critical |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Features** | - White-label dashboards<br>- Role-based permissions<br>- Multi-campus support<br>- API for custom integrations | Universities demand enterprise |
| **Architecture** | - Kubernetes (EKS $100/mo)<br>- Multi-tenant DB (row-level security)<br>- GraphQL API | 1000 colleges scale |
| **Technical** | - Auth0 + Okta SSO<br>- CDN + CloudFront<br>- SOC2 compliance path | Enterprise sales requirements |
| **Business** | - $50k university contracts<br>- State education dept partnerships<br>- Affiliate program (ERP resellers) | Winner-take-most market |

**Success:** 50 colleges, $100k ARR. **Cost:** $500/mo. **Exit:** Acquired by PowerSchool/Blackbaud.

## Strategic Dependencies & Kill Triggers

| Phase | Must-Hit Metric | Fail → Pivot |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Phase 1** | 1 pilot CSV dataset | Dead project |
| **Phase 2** | 15% failure reduction | Pure attendance tool |
| **Phase 3** | 3 paid colleges ($5k ARR) | Consulting services |
| **Phase 4** | ML AUC > 0.80 | Stay rules-based |
| **Phase 5** | 20 colleges ($50k ARR) | Sell to ERP vendor |

***

## Solo Builder Reality Check

```
MVP (Now):           100% solo feasible ✓
Phase 1-2 (3mo):     100% solo feasible ✓ 
Phase 3 (ERP):       NEEDS co-founder (sales) ⚠️
Phase 4 (ML):        NEEDS data scientist ❌
Phase 5 (SaaS):      NEEDS full team ❌
```

**Solo Ceiling:** Phase 2 max. $10k ARR then stalls without team.

***

## Funding Path (Bootstrap → VC)

```
$0 → Hackathon win → Phase 1 ($0)
$100/mo → Phase 2 pilots ($500 total)
$1k → Phase 3 sales co-founder equity
$50k → Phase 4 ML contractor
$500k → Phase 5 VC seed round
```

***

## Kill Criteria (Be Ruthless)

| Month | Metric | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Month 3** | 0 pilots | Kill |
| **Month 6** | <$3k ARR | Pivot to attendance-only |
| **Month 9** | <10 colleges | Sell IP to ERP |
| **Month 12** | No sales co-founder | Lifestyle business |

***

## Execution Priority (Next 7 Days)

```
1. [Today] Deploy hackathon MVP to cloud
2. [Day 2] Email 5 faculty contacts with demo link
3. [Week 1] Fix pilot feedback → Phase 1 complete
4. [Week 2] Secure 1 pilot → Phase 2 begins
```

**Status: STRATEGICALLY SOUND.** Hackathon win = runway to Phase 2. No pilots by Month 3 = dead. Execute flawlessly. Pivot fast.

**First Milestone:** Deploy live demo by midnight. Pitch faculty tomorrow. Win hackathon first.
