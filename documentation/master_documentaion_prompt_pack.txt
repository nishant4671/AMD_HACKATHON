Good.

Now we are entering **professional execution mode**.

You want:

👉 A separate high-quality prompt
👉 For EACH documentation file
👉 So your other AI generates them individually
👉 Structured, implementation-ready
👉 Hackathon-optimized
👉 Future-scalable

I will give you elite-level prompts.

You copy-paste each into your other AI one by one.

No fluff. No repetition. Clean and powerful.
